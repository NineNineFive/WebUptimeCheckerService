# WebUptimeCheckerService
The aim of the WebUptimeCheckerService project is to make yet another uptimedetector, that tracks selected websites in certain intervals and saves the request data with response times and more. It also creates an analysis upon uptime for documentation purposes.


This project is to be developed on in 2023
